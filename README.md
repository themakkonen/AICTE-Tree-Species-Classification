# 🌿 Tree Species Classification Using Deep Learning

This project was developed as part of the **Shell–Edunet Skills4Future AICTE-Approved Internship** (July–August 2025), under the theme **"Green Skills using AI Technologies"**. It focuses on building an automated system to classify tree species from image data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Identifying tree species manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires domain expertise. The goal of this project is to build a deep learning-based model that automates this process by classifying tree species from images, aiding in biodiversity conservation, forestry management, and environmental monitoring.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Prepare image datasets for deep learning classification tasks.
- Build a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Train and evaluate the model on a labeled dataset.
- Automate the prediction of tree species from new images.
- Demonstrate the application of AI in environmental sustainability.

   - Applied data augmentation (if necessary)  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
   - Added convolutional, pooling, and dense layers  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Trained on training set with validation split  
   - Tuned epochs and batch size for performance  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated model using accuracy and loss metrics  
   - Visualized results using training curves  

6. **Prediction & Output**  
   - Performed predictions on new images  
   - Displayed prediction outputs with class labels
